# SlushPuppy

Information about your Slush's Pool Bitcoin miner, Bitcoin exchange rate, and wallet balance.

**Written for Android.**

## Requirements

SlushPuppy requires GSON to run.

Tested with:
Gson 2.2.4 - http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

## API Keys

In addition to libraries, you will also need your API token from your account at Slush's Pool:

This token can be defined in the User class.

Slush puppy also utilizes APIs from Mt. Gox and BlockChain, though these do not require tokens.
